% datatype conversion%
% to check the datatype for any variable, use the 'whos' like 'whos a'
% outputs the datatype for variable a
%to convert from one datatype to another, for instance from double to
%int32, you would say 'int32(a)', and it outputs the value of a as int.
% strings are writen with single quotation marks
%you can get help by typing 'help' and or without what you want to know
%about. e.g 'help int32'
