<Info description="This model shows how to model NASA's HL-20 lifting body modeled with Simulink(R), Stateflow(R) and Aerospace Blockset(TM) software. The vehicle model includes the aerodynamics, control logic, fault management systems (FDIR), and engine controls (FADEC). It also includes effects of the environment, such as wind profiles for the landing phase. The entire model simulates approach and landing flight phases using an auto-landing controller. Visualization for this model is done via an interface to FlightGear, an open source flight simulator package. If the FlightGear interface is unavailable, you can simulate the model by closing the loop using the alternative data sources provided in the Variant block. In this block, you can choose a previously saved data file, a Signal Builder block, or a set of constant values. This example requires Control System Toolbox(TM)." />
